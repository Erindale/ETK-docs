   The ETK_Camera Cull node.

The **Camera Cull** group handles culling points to the view area, also
called `Frustum Culling <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewing_frustum>`_.
The node requires a camera object to function
as the culling is calculated based on the location and rotation of the
camera.

The node works both with the vertices of the object or with points
generated by a :ref:`etk-utilities-point_distribute` node. The two
outputs contain the points inside and outside the view region of the
camera.

For any special transforms you want to do based on proximity to the
edge of the view, use the *Region* attribute output. A gradient towards
the middle of view starting at 0 on the edges.
