   The ETK_Torus node.

A torus is a donut shape generated by revolving a circle in 3D space
about an axis that is coplanar with the circle. The **ETK_Torus** node
group is used to generate a torus coplanar to the XY plane, rotating
around the Z-axis.


Inputs
=======

|FLOAT_FIELD_SINGLE| Major Radius
   The distance from the Z-axis to the center of the revolving circle
   to form the torus.

|FLOAT_FIELD_SINGLE| Minor Radius
   This value sizes the circle that is rotated around the
   Z-axis to form the torus.

|INTEGER| Major Segments
   The number of segments in the major radius, determining the
   resolution of the donut.

|INTEGER| Minor Segments
   The resolution of the revolving circle

|FLOAT_FIELD_SINGLE| Twist
   The amount of rotation that the revolving circle makes as it forms
   the torus.

|FLOAT_FIELD_SINGLE| U Min
   The starting angle around the Z-axis in radians.

|FLOAT_FIELD_SINGLE| U Max
   The ending angle around the Z-axis. *U Min* and *U Max* can be used
   to constrain the path of the revolving circle.

|FLOAT_FIELD_SINGLE| V Min
   The starting angle in radians of the revolving circle.

|FLOAT_FIELD_SINGLE| V Max
   The ending angle in radians of the revolving circle. *V Min* and *V
   Max* can be used to rotate partial circles around the Z-axis.

|FLOAT| U Phase
   Adjusts the rotation around the Z-axis.

|FLOAT| V Phase
   Adjusts the rotation of the revolving circle.


Outputs
========

|GEOMETRY| Geometry
   The generated geometry.

|INTEGER| Size
   The number of points generated.

|FLOAT_FIELD| U Fac
   A 0..1 gradient of the major axis as it traverses around the Z-axis.

|FLOAT_FIELD| V Fac
   A 0..1 gradient of the minor axis of the revolving circle.

|VECTOR| Rotation
   Rotation vector for each point.


Example Usage

   Using the **Torus** group to create a
   `möebius <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip>`_
   torus. A small even *Minor Segment* value is used to accentuate the
   shape and the torus is given a *twist* of 180° to form the shape.
